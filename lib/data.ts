        "short_profile": "The developing countries (like Bangladesh) are lagging behind the developed nations in the use of computers and information technology. This is due to the fact that the developing countries lack in knowledge and the cost of the technology is beyond purchasing capacity of the expected users. Another factor contributing to this is that the developing nations cannot invest desired amount on the development of infrastructure facilities for data communication and information interchange.  Generally speaking, no noticeable IT industry -hardware and software, has been developed yet in Bangladesh. Most of the business limited to selling and reselling of foreign made software and hardware. To make computer installation sustainable, home grown software and hardware is a necessity. Being aspirant to export software, data entry services and facilities management services in the international market, Bangladesh needs ISO standard professional software development and data entry services trained manpower.",

        "short_profile": "Backspace is an innovative MediaTech company that has developed a connected ecosystem, enabling seamless integration of various elements of media and technology. Backspace empowers its stakeholders to advance in the constantly evolving landscape of information and communication.Soon after, the company diverted its resources and focus to Affiliate Marketing through our website, recognizing the opportunity and merit in this method of marketing. The company ran a website that provided detailed information on products and services.Observing the success of the website with Affiliate Marketing and getting a taste of Digital Marketing, backspace wanted to expand its boundaries. That came with the inception of the YouTube channel which delivered quality video content on product reviews. The success of our channel allowed us to hold a strong position and get more partners for affiliation. In this period, backspace expanded its focus to video content, rather than just textual content only.Both the website and YouTube channel were big successes and Backspace started its own video production agency. That opened up the door for another big opportunity as we started collaborating with international e-commerce marketplaces like Banggood, GearBest and partnering up with global brands like LG, and Whirlpool. BlitzWolf and Insta360. It also heavily partnered up with Amazon sellers in various aspects of digital and affiliate marketing and collaborated with several crowd-funded projects in various capacities.In 2019, the company started making content on shopping guides and animated documentaries for different platforms. Then in 2020, the company gradually started producing more digital content for its partners and became the partner of Amazon creator hub to make shopping guides in the form of videos for Amazon’s visitors. Now the company is aiming to provide its partners with superior content marketing, and affiliate marketing with relevant product videos, and animated content. Review Zone, one of Backspace’s largest ventures, was born at that moment because the market demand was rising like never before. In this period, the resources employed by Backspace have tripled than it was at the beginning. In addition to that, Backspace also needed to expand its physical location to accommodate the increasing resources.As the new decade started, Backspace came up with multiple ventures to work on within the upcoming days. The new ventures include Research-Based Online Media, Content Production & Marketing, Digital marketing, and E-Commerce. Backspace expanded its physical location once again to cope with its incremental activities. The Review Zone sums up about 14 brands so far and more are forthcoming.",

Legal basis for CDBL's operations is set out in the Depositories Act 1999, Depositories Regulations 2000, Depository (User) Regulations 2003, and the CDBL by-laws.CDBL's core services cover the efficient delivery, settlement and transfer of securities through computerized book entry system i.e. recording and maintaining securities accounts and registering transfer of securities; changing the ownership without any physical movement or endorsement of certificates and execution of transfer instruments. The Central Depository System (CDS) operated by CDBL has proved to be a convenient and reliable means to settle securities transaction.

Network connectivity to Depository Participants, Issuers, Banks and Stock Exchanges is through Front End interfaces accessed by WAN link.Live operations of the CDS commenced with the inauguration of the Electronic Government Securities Registry (EGSR) by the Governor of Bangladesh Bank on 20 th October 2003. The EGSR also serves as a platform for secondary market sale/purchase as well as Repo transactions of government securities to commercial banks linked online to the CDS. Equity market securities dematerialization process i.e. eliminating physical certificate as record of security ownership by substituting it as an electronic book entry record in the CDS commenced on 24 th January 2004 with the entry of Square Pharmaceuticals Limited into the CDS.Since 14th February 2003 CDBL has been acting as National Numbering Agency for International Securities Identification Number (ISIN) as partner in Bangladesh of Association of National Numbering Agencies (ANNA) based in Germany.

It was setup in 2009 when this industry appeared to be saturated, but they thought they will still give it a try in setting up their own business in providing web based solutions, services and web design, at a minimal cost. They have two development centers – one in Ireland and the other in Bangladesh, taking advantage of the geographical locations and time zones.Like any startup, success did not happen overnight! European IT tried hard to find and attract clients, while they were developing their own software for in-house usage. Finally, the breakthrough came with a corporate client in December 2009 and there has been no turning back ever since. They setup a sales and marketing office in Munich, Germany and New Delhi, India in 2011 and will soon be setting up an office in Montreal, Canada.European IT also provides website domain registration and offers very competitive hosting packages.European IT tries to use simple, yet elegant design for websites. Keeping the limitations of mobile phones for web browsing in mind, they try not to use heavy embedding or develop Flash based websites unless specifically requested by a client. Their applications are developed mainly using PHP, Javascript, MySQL or other open source languages. For the products, Oracle database can be used depending on the client’s licensing capacity. The company has expanded its knowledge in the Android OS for development of mobile applications.European IT has expertise in a range of tools from Pitney Bowes Business Insight’s Customer Communication Management suite. We provide customized solutions for banks, telecommunication companies and other businesses using Sagent Dataflow, DOC1, and PCE.",

However, Instasure believe digitally-enhanced services are no longer a nice-to-have and it's a shift no industry can ignore. The sector of insurance shouldn't be an exception. With the purpose of breaking the 0.4% insurance penetration barrier in Bangladesh, we built the first-ever 'insurance-as-a-service' platform in Bangladesh capable of meeting the rapidly evolving needs of today's Gen Z. Better cover for less cost and fast claim processing using technology. If this wasn't enough, Instasure is removing all excess on claims and allowing you to switch your cover off and back on with the push of a button.Instasure distributes insurance products through the 'ecosystem partners', and this ecosystem is vast. From ecommerce portals selling a multitude of products to travel sites selling air tickets and tour plans, and MFIs selling small-ticket loans, everyone is a part of the ecosystem for Instasure. We thus enables large insurance companies to reach out to ecosystem partners at zero marginal cost using its proprietary embedded insurance API suite. It allows the insurance companies to help assess the risk better, streamline partner and customer interaction, enhance claim settlement as well as make transactions smooth.",

We aim to develop a system for early screening of Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) and Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Based on this work, we also aim to develop a prediction model for screening individuals at risk of systemic diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and CVD. A retinal imaging-based system will screen these diseases from regular visits to Family Physician, Community Clinics, Optometrist, or Ophthalmologist. An integrated screening system will help prevent these diseases, improve the patient’s quality of life, and save billions of dollars in healthcare costs. Today, the telemedicine field is changing faster than ever before. Therefore, another aim is to develop a telemedicine platform. Telemedicine was initially intended to treat patients who were located in remote places, far away from health facilities, or in areas of shortages of medical professionals. Telemedicine is still used today to address these problems. It’s increasingly become a tool for convenient medical care. Today’s connected patient wants to waste less time in the waiting room, and get immediate care when they decide they want or need the care. Achievements of iHealthScreen.",

We always have our finger on the pulse of current market trends. This enables us not only to meet individual company and industry-specific needs but also to flourish continuously.It was in 2016 when JMJ Code started its journey with eye full of hope and belief to provide software services in Bangladesh. The institutors have invested their time, effort and patience to fulfill their dream to provide maximal output to the clients in this fourth industrial revolution arena. Inception of the journey was not so plain sailing. Our integrity, commitment, expertise, team work, the motto of serving maximal output have made our path smooth and the trust of our clients helps us be on the right track in this mission.  In this era of digitalization and automation, the economy of Bangladesh largely depends on the textile industry. But automation in this sector is not that consequential to emulate the global economy. As there exists substantial gap, JMJ has planned to provide software solutions for this particular industry with a view to reducing human physical activity, paperwork and time constraints. While JMJ was struggling to get big clients, Young Labels, a leading manufacturer of labels, put their trust on us in late 2016 as our first client to take ERP facilities from us. And we have successfully kept our commitment to deliver maximal output within scheduled time and by meeting all the requirements.As a start-up, we aspire to become the best service providers in the industry by building relationships with the clients. Our clients are our partners and we dream to grow together.",

Our expertise in the hosting market has taught us that automation is the key to efficiency. Limda Host has automated all of the operations that many hosting providers still undertake by hand behind the scenes. Our powerful software and automated processes handle everything from deploying new servers to tracking malware to dealing with denial of Service attacks.

We simply want to keep running a lucrative web hosting company that delights its consumers. We've backed up our rock-solid hosting solutions and top-notch infrastructure with the greatest customer service and technical support from the beginning.

Yes, a successful company must be dedicated to client solutions, innovation, creativity, and a friendly, caring approach toward all of our clients' business requirements. We don't only offer support 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We genuinely listen and care about what you have to say.",

Arc Bangladesh’s fields of expertise and services include professional consultancy; software systems development; GIS and geospatial solutions and services; database and data conversion and ICT outsourcing services. Among the industries or sectors in which we have in-depth knowledge and authoritative command includes land, urban growth planning, environment and water management, utility network, infrastructure and government administrations.Plans, coordinates, and directs activities of workers concerned with conducting aerial surveys using Drone/Quadcopter and preparing topographic materials from aerial photographs and other data: Analyzes survey objectives and specifications, utilizing knowledge of survey uses, such as ecological planning, property and utility mapping. Selects most appropriate and economical survey methods, using knowledge of capabilities of aerial photography and applications of remote sensing. Advises customers and department supervisors regarding flights for aerial photography and plans for ground surveys designed to establish base lines, elevations, and other geodetic measurements. Prepares charts and tables for aerial navigation, to specify flight path, altitude, and airspeed of camera-carrying aircraft. Computes geodetic measurements and interprets survey data from ground or aerial photographs or remote-sensing images to determine position, shape, and elevation of geomorphic and topographic features. Conducts research in surveying and mapping methods and procedures, using knowledge of techniques of photogrammetric map compilation, electronic data processing, and flight and control planning. May direct one or more phases of technical operations concerned with preparing survey proposals, negotiating with clients, scheduling activities, conducting surveys, processing data, reviewing work quality, and training and assigning personnel.Omni Dot Com Ltd has the capability to conduct Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) and provide Environmental Management Plans (EMP) and can produce Environmental Statements (ESs) for a diverse range of development projects through to providing specific environmental appraisals and technical reports for residential property developments. Our approach is to focus the EIA process upon the key issues and take a proportionate approach to the assessment to minimize project risk and maximize opportunities for success.By consolidating and capitalizing our valuable experiences, Omni Dot Com has grown organically to its current strength and reputation. It has been providing diverse professional services through four operation units and at present, is maintaining a payroll of 64 people, consisting of managers, IT specialists, and technical and support staff either on permanent or project-based employment arrangement.One of Arc Bangladesh’s strength lies on its ability to assemble a top rate team of experts in the fields of geospatial and information technology, land information management, land use survey and digital cadastral, topographic and geodetic surveys, and urban growth planning.Omni Dot Com has a simple and clear mission to help solve problems, enhance productivity and improve customer satisfaction by providing innovative, quality and cost-effective solutions and services in the field of geospatial and information technology applications. Continuing deregulation is causing a revolution for large and small companies alike. The issues are the same; you need to be more responsive, more competitive, and more efficient. The question is how do you do this without the big budgets? While traditional geospatial technology suppliers have spent considerable time and money trying to serve only the very large organizations, who has looked at the problems and concerns from a smaller company view? Well, we have! Our total solution approach eliminates the need for large Information Systems staff, minimizes expenditures and enables quicker start-up (or conversion) and operation. To you, this means a completely integrated solution that solves specific problems for less money. Omni Dot Com solutions and services represent the most effective technologies in managing geospatial information and advanced analysis and modeling of spatial data and imagery. We embrace the latest industry standards in data exchange, open systems, relational and object-oriented database technology, graphical user interfaces and distributed computing. However, what really separates us from others is our emphasis on total customer service. How often in the past have you purchased a product or service only to have the supplier all but disappear once the bank check was cashed! We have a simple but overriding company goal: clients for life - long term client relationships via exceptional service and support. Lastly, we offer some of the most competitive rates in the industry. Highly competitive pricing coupled with our service and support provides a package that we believe is unparalleled in the industry.Our unique experience and skills, total solution approach and focus on our clients have enabled us to double revenues every year since our inception.",

To ensure easy availability and customer satisfaction of this set top box, we formed Plaas Tech Industries (Private) Limited in 2014.In the initial stages we manufacture a complete domestic set-top box using German machinery and Chinese raw materials. We continue to produce less products for up to 3 years despite the shortage of skilled manpower. Last year, we joined the Telecast Company of China through Joint Venture and we have already started producing more than one million boxes in full swing. We are not the only manufacturer of STB, as many digital heads and control rooms have been built in Bangladesh, we have made 70% of them.",

Our software has proven results of a monthly productivity increase of minimum 27000 units in a factory with ten production lines. This shows critical significance in the current industry landscape experiencing local and international competition. The current gap in the market is mitigated by providing assistance customized to individual business needs in all major business processes including inventory and warehouse management, payroll accounting, operation planning and control among many other features developed to enhance business performance across the entire industry. Aside from a much lower CM, investors will receive completely digitized and accurate real-time information regarding CPM, EPM and daily targets free of biases, which facilitates remote supervision. The individual KPIs set and increased scope of supervision will impact productivity, as well as overall worker morale and job satisfaction positively. Our software decreases cost from redundancy of line managers and internal auditors, lower maintenance costs, automated operation bulletin with SMV calculations, reduces wastage enabling companies to go completely paperless, instigating positive social change. Innovation for revolution should be targeted for prolonged sustainability, and we are dedicated to facilitate this transition into the era of the 4th Industrial Revolution.",
